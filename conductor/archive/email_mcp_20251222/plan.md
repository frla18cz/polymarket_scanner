# Plan: Email Integration (Standalone Scripts)

## Phase 1: Environment & Boilerplate
- [x] Task: Verify Dependencies
- [x] Task: Set up basic scripts (check_emails.py, send_email.py)

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] Task: Implement IMAP Reading (unread listing)
- [x] Task: Implement SMTP Sending
- [x] Task: Implement Email Search
- [x] Task: Consolidate logic into user-friendly scripts

## Status Update (2025-12-27)
Decided to skip MCP server implementation as it was unnecessarily complex for current needs. 
Functional standalone scripts `check_emails.py` and `send_email.py` are available and verified.
