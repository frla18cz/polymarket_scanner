## FAQ
1. **What is PolyLab?**
   PolyLab is an independent market scanner and analytics dashboard for Polymarket. It aggregates active prediction markets and enriches them with calculated metrics like APR, spread, and liquidity depth to help you find better betting opportunities.

2. **How is APR calculated?**
   The Annualized Percentage Rate (APR) is an estimate based on the current outcome price and the time remaining until the market expires. It represents the potential return if the current odds hold true, extrapolated to a full year. *Please note: These are estimates, not guaranteed returns.*

3. **Why is the data updated hourly?**
   PolyLab currently performs a full snapshot of the Gamma API every hour. This provides a stable baseline for research and position scouting without the volatility of second-by-second price fluctuations.

4. **Is PolyLab affiliated with Polymarket?**
   No. PolyLab is an independent third-party tool. We are not officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or partnered with Polymarket.

5. **How can I contact you?**
