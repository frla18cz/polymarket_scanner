**Subject:** PolyLab - High-performance Polymarket Scanner 🧪

Hey everyone! 👋

I just built **PolyLab** (https://www.polylab.app) - a free tool to help find better opportunities on Polymarket.

**Features:**
*   🚀 **Fast Filtering:** Filter by Volume, Liquidity, Spread, and Price.
*   📈 **Real-time APR:** See annualized returns for every market.
*   🔍 **Advanced Search:** Include/Exclude specific categories.

It's open-source (mostly) and built with Python/FastAPI + Vue. Would love any feedback or feature requests!
