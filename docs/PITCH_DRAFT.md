# Pitch Draft: Polymarket Integration / Feature

**Subject:** Better Discovery for Polymarket: PolyLab Scanner 🧪

Hi Polymarket Team,

I've been a huge fan of the platform and wanted to share a tool I've built to help users discover betting opportunities more efficiently: **PolyLab** (https://www.polylab.app).

**What is PolyLab?**
It's a high-performance scanner that enriches Gamma API data with calculated metrics:
- **Real-time APR (Win):** Annualized returns based on time to expiry.
- **Spread & Liquidity Analysis:** Quickly find the tightest markets.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Search by category, probability range, and volume.

**Why it matters:**
Many "safe" high-probability outcomes or high-yield long shots are buried in the UI. PolyLab surface these in seconds.

**Demo:**

I'd love to hear your thoughts or see if there's any way to integrate these insights more closely with the community.

Best,
Ondrej Frlicka
PolyLab Creator
